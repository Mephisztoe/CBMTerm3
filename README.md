# CBMTerm3
CBMTerm3 is a new (2017) version of the classic CBMTerm.
CBMTerm3 is a PETSCII terminal for Windows, with a nod to CCGMS.
It has been tested on a number of bulletin board systems, and is AFAIK the most compatible PETSCII term available.

## What's New?
* Now using MonoGame instead of XNA
* Punter and XModem File Transfer Protocols
* Baud Emulation (300/1200/2400/None)

## What works?
* C/G Emulation
* Viewing SEQ Files
* Editing and saving PETSCII files
* Capture Buffer
* Address Book
* Sending/Receiving files with either XModem or Punter

## What needs work?
* Baud Emulation's menu control on the main form
* 2400 baud seems slow, needs tested
* File transfer dialogs are still really rough
